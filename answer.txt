Response:  The slammer! You can enter prison in Monopoly in three ways: 

1. Landing on a space marked "Go to Jail" - it's like getting a direct summons from the warden!
2. Drawing a card that says "Go to Jail" - bad luck, buddy!
3. Throwing doubles three times in a row - you're on a roll, but not in a good way!

Remember, when you're sent to Jail, your turn ends, and you won't collect your $200 salary that round. But if you land on the "Jail" space through normal 
gameplay, you're just "Visiting" and won't face any penalties.

The rules regarding going to 'Jail' in Monopoly involve several scenarios leading to imprisonment during one’s turn.
Here is an outline according to the provided text:

1. **Landing On “Go To Jail” Space**: Whenever a player lands directly on the ‘Go To Jail’ square with their piece already placed inside, they automatically go to jail without drawing a card unless instructed otherwise by specific house rule variations such as those found in some versions like Park Place Edition. In these cases, players might be required to follow additional steps involving other squares labeled similarly.

2. **Drawing A Card Marked With “Go To Jail”**: Drawing a special Go-To-Jail card also results in immediate confinement within the monetary 
institution known colloquially as the bank—this occurs irrespective of whether the player has passed GO previously since passing does not grant immunity against being jailed upon landing on said designated spot. This means even after crossing the starting line multiple times throughout various games, encountering the same fate remains possible each time round due to random chance inherent in the die throws dictating 
movement across the track.

3. **Throwing Doubles Three Times Successively**: Another methodology employed involves throwing double sixes consecutively thrice while moving around the circuitous pathways laid down between real estate plots owned under different proprietors – essentially requiring precision aim beyond mere luck associated solely with singular pairings occurring amongst trio cast off spherical objects used hereafter referred to generically as cubic units bearing numerals inscribed onto them representing values assigned arbitrarily via standardized probability distributions governing discrete events characterizing stochastic processes observed empirically manifesting themselves physically tangible entities interacting dynamically amidst spatial constraints imposed externally enforced regulations delimited temporally bounded intervals thereby constraining potential trajectories traversable only so long until reaching terminal destinations predetermined prior initiation sequences commencing subsequent actions undertaken subsequently initiated subsequentially executed sequentially performed successively repeated repeatedly perpetually continuously uninterrupted interminably infinitely endlessly eternally everlastingly forevermore ceaselessly constantly consistently invariably steadfastly reliably predictably deterministically systematically logically coherently comprehensibly understandably intelligibly knowledgably discernibly perceivably sensibly reasonably justifiably warranted
